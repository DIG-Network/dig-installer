// component identifiers the Rust install pipeline understands (mirrors the
// `dig-installer --help-json` "components" list: digstore, dig-node,
// dig-relay, dig-dns, browser). The default one-click path installs the core
// DIG stack (digstore + dig-node + dig-dns); digstore is `req: true` (the CLI
// itself, always installed). `dig-relay` is `on: false` (task #491 — advanced/
// optional: most users use the canonical relay.dig.net, so it is present +
// selectable but NOT pre-checked). `browser` is `hidden: true` (task #491 —
// not offered in the installer for now; the entry is kept for easy re-enable,
// and `Components.jsx` does not render a `hidden` component). This mirrors the
// CLI defaults (`InstallPlan::default()`: dig-relay + browser are opt-in only,
// `--with-relay`/`--with-browser`).
